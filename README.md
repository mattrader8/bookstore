# Bookstore Web Application

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a **Bookstore web application** developed as part of a **Web Application Design course** completed during my master’s program at Virginia Tech in **2021**.

The project was designed to demonstrate foundational and intermediate concepts in modern web application development, including frontend design, backend integration, and basic data management patterns (e.g., Data Access Object [DAO], CRUD, etc.). While created in an academic setting, the application reflects real-world architectural considerations and development workflows.

**Purpose of this repository**:<br>
This project is maintained on GitHub as a **reference implementation** showcasing my approach to web application development and software design. Note that evironment-specific configuration is required to run locally.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project were to:
- Design and implement a functional, multi-page web application
- Apply core web development principles (MVC patterns, RESTful services, etc.)
- Demonstrate CRUD-style interactions typical of real-world applications
- Practice clean, readable, and maintainable code organization
- Gain experience integrating frontend and backend components

## Key Features
 - Book catalog browsing and display
 - Shopping cart and checkout functionality
 - User interaction flows (e.g., user forms, data lists, etc.)
 - Application state management via Vuex (https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
